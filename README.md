# Early Python Projects

This repository contains small projects and practice scripts I created during my first few weeks learning Python.

## Projects

### `schizobot-v1.py`
A basic rule-based chatbot that can greet users, tell jokes, and respond to simple commands.

### `floydquiz-v1.py`
A Pink Floyd-themed quiz game with multiple-choice questions and score tracking.

More projects will be added as I continue learning.
