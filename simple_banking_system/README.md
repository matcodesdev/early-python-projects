# 🏦 Simple Banking System (Python)

A command-line banking simulation written in Python. This early-stage project demonstrates how to use classes, control flow, and user interaction to simulate basic banking functions.

## 📌 Features

- Create new accounts with auto-generated account numbers
- Password-protected account creation
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Balance checks
- View account details (with password masking)
- Interactive terminal menu using `input()` and `time.sleep()` for UX polish

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Python Classes & OOP
- Class vs. Instance Variables
- Dictionaries for object storage
- Control Flow (if, while, try/except)
- Input validation (partially implemented)
- Separation of data and interface logic

- 🔐 Add password strength validation (length, digits, uppercase)
- 🔁 Return to main menu after account creation (currently exits after one)
- 💾 Save accounts persistently (JSON, CSV, or database)
